## Dockerized Flask App
This project demonstrates how to convert a simple Flask web application written in Python into a Docker image.

### Flask Overview
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, making it one of the simplest ways to build web applications. Itâ€™s great for getting a web application up and running quickly with minimal setup.

### Building the Docker Image
To create the Docker image for the Flask app, I used the following command:   
docker build -t ruwanthilakshika/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE .

### Running the Docker Image
To run the Docker image and map it to port 3000, I used:        
docker container run -d -p 3000:3000 ruwanthilakshika/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE

### Changing the Running Port
If you need to change the port that the container is running on, you can do so with:     
docker container run -d -p 4000:3000 ruwanthilakshika/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE

### Pushing the Image to Docker Hub
To share this Docker image, I pushed it to Docker Hub using:       
docker push ruwanthilakshika/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE
